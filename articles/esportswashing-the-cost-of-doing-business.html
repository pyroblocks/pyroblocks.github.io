                        <p>Throughout the course of 2024, one thing has been made clear: the esports bubble has
                            significantly flattened. After years of near-exponential growth across various games and
                            scenes, the unsure profitability of the industry has led to major investors and
                            organizations backing out or slashing funding, and this esports winter is far from over.
                            However, one major entity has decided to jump on the bandwagon at a time when many have
                            stepped off: Saudi Arabia.</p>
                        <p>The term “sportswashing” entered public knowledge for many with the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
                            The word describes the process of using sports to improve something’s reputation, in this
                            case that of various Middle Eastern nations. Saudi Arabia, through its $776,000,000,000
                            Public Investment Fund, has extended this policy to the esports realm through Savvy Games
                            Group, which has made a remarkable impact on the scene since being founded in 2021. Despite
                            providing a massive supplement of funding into esports at a time when it’s desperately
                            needed, however, the usage of esports to cover up human rights abuses as well as
                            discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and women has presented more questions than
                            answers to the industry. It’s all resulted in uncertainty over the role that SGG and Saudi
                            Arabia will play in these next few pivotal years.</p>
                        <p>Six months before the first kickoff in Qatar back in 2022, esports organizations, teams, and
                            players gathered for the first-ever Saudi-sponsored international event, dubbed Gamers8. It
                            was this event where initial concerns over esportswashing began to arise among fans, but it
                            would take until the $50,000,000 <a href="https://liquipedia.net/esports/Gamers8/2023">Gamers8 2023</a> event (and a <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIilD9qAzeA">video commentary by
                                VALORANT commentator Josh “Sideshow” Wilkinson”</a>) for many of the participants to
                            fully grasp
                            the situation around the sponsorship of these massive tournaments.</p>
                        <p>“My frame of reference was that the government wanted to throw an event because they were a
                            fan of esports,” said professional Rocket League commentator Sean “Spaceman” Rogers. “I
                            don’t think anybody was entirely as informed as we came to be a year later.” As a
                            commentator at <a href="https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Gamers8/2022">Gamers8 2022</a>, Rogers felt that the sentiment among those participating was
                            that being aware of and speaking out against the potential Saudi human rights violations was
                            enough, but as more information about the event’s funding became available, his tone
                            shifted. “If I got an offer this year, I would not go.”</p>
                        <p>The bulk of the responsibility for running these massive events falls to ESL, a company that
                            helps organize esports tournaments and is currently the highest-valued esports company in
                            the world. It was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/savvy-gaming-group-purchases-esl-gaming-and-faceit">acquired by Savvy Games Group in 2022</a>. “ESL is a very good company with
                            very good people and a very good mission statement, and they’re getting caught in the
                            crossfires by the way that they were bought out,” said Rogers. Even with ESL getting a pass
                            from the majority of the esports world thanks to its extended degree of separation from
                            Saudi investment, its role in supporting esportswashing events — including Gamers8 — still
                            garners questions. “They [Saudi Arabia] will go to a tournament organizer, and they will put
                            on the tournament,” said Jens Koornstra, the lead editor of popular Rocket League news
                            website ShiftRLE. “When it comes to the first step, it’s the tournament organizers… they
                            bear the biggest responsibility.”</p>
                        <p>Given the controversy surrounding Gamers8 (now the Esports World Cup), the question of
                            competing in the first place has fallen to organizations, teams, and players. But how much
                            responsibility can they really assume, given the exposure and revenue that these
                            competitions generate? “It’s a very difficult choice [for organizations]... but to say
                            they’re backed into a corner is a little bit of wishful thinking that they actually care,”
                            said Koornstra. “They [organizations] will make a lot of decisions for players… I would say
                            there is limited responsibility there.” Team Liquid Co-CEO Victor Goosens said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamLiquid/status/1679883703496081410">2023 statement</a>
                            that not participating in esportswashed events would lead to “all sorts of challenges” when
                            it comes to maintaining funding and high levels of brand recognition. Even when it comes to
                            organizations and players that do want to take action, it would take a movement from almost
                            all participants to drive any sort of change. Koornstra describes such a movement as a
                            “prisoner’s dilemma,” where organizational apathy and a need for revenue during a difficult
                            financial period prevents any mass effort from gaining steam. Very few teams have declined
                            an invite to the premier Saudi Arabian tournament as a result.</p>
                        <p>With the growing prevalence of Saudi Arabian events within the esports scene, their influence
                            in the communities of the games they sponsor, as well as the industry as a whole, seems set
                            to increase. “Saudi Arabia is looking to make the esports scene a monopoly of theirs,” said
                            Koornstra, with Rogers adding that funding esports during a time of financial difficulty
                            “will give them a seat at the table.”</p>
                        <p>This all leaves fans in a bit of a precarious position when it comes to their decision to
                            watch these massive events featuring their favorite teams and players. Ultimately, though,
                            not much can be done from their position, besides being aware. Koornstra noted, “you can
                            speak out while also watching these events, [spreading awareness] is more important than
                            being called a hypocrite.” When there are millions upon millions of dollars in play, there’s
                            just not much the average person can do besides keep themselves in the know. It appears as
                            if that’s all they can do for now.</p>
                        <p>It appears as if, for better or for worse, Saudi Arabia will continue to hold a strong
                            presence in the esports world for years to come. The question of what this means for the future of the scene is left to the organizations, players, and fans that created it in the first place.</p>
